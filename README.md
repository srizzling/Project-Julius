Project Julius
==============


Description
-----------
A personal dashboard for mw to keep on track with Assignments/Deadlines/Meetings and other "productive" stuff. Because really I am just procastinating and not doing my assignments right now.


Plan
----
Current Plan to aggregate all the data and services that I use into dashboard that can visualize it all, and put it in one page. I would like to include the following services to my dashboard:

* Facebook Notifications
* Google Calender
* Trello Board
* Assignments Left: To-do/Doing/Done
* Assignment Due Dates
* Todo lists
* Github Activity (i.e commits made)
